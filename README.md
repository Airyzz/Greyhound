Greyhound is a fork of [Wraith Archon](https://github.com/dtzxporter/WraithXArchon). Originally developed by the legend DTZxPorter, it is the Call of Duty Asset Extractor, supporting XModels, XAnims, and more depending, from Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare all the way up to the latest releases. With Greyhound we hope to bring more features, etc. and ensure updates for game updates.
