Welcome to Greyhound. Greyhound is a fork of the famous [Wraith Archon](https://github.com/dtzxporter/WraithXArchon). Originally developed by the legend DTZxPorter/Nick, it is a Call of Duty Asset Extractor, supporting many formats/assets from Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare all the way up to the latest titles including Call of Duty: WWII and Call of Duty: Black Ops IIII. It's lightweight, fast, and easy to use.

For information on Game Support and in-depth information, see the [Wiki](https://github.com/Scobalula/Greyhound/wiki).
